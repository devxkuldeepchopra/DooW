In East Asia, perfumes were incense based.  People used to make perfumes from spices and herbs like bergamot, myrtle, coriander, conifer resin, and almond.  The use of flowers came only after Avicenna, an Iranian doctor and chemist showed the process of distillation, whereby oils could be extracted from flowers.  In 1370, at the behest of Queen Elizabeth of Hungary, the world////s first modern perfume - \"Hungary Water\" was made by blending scented oils in alcohol solution.\r\n\r\nThe composition of a perfume is of vital significance and is handled by an expert known as a perfumer, who deals with primary scents like rose, jasmine, cola, etc; modifiers like esters; blenders like linalool and hydroxycitronellol; and fixatives like resins, wood scents, and amber bases.  The resulting scent is explained in a musical metaphor of three ////notes////, namely, top notes (consisting of fast evaporating small size molecules) like citrus and ginger scents; middle notes (consisting of slow evaporating medium size molecules) like lavender and rose scents; and base notes (consisting of slowest evaporating largest size molecules) like fixatives etc.  All these notes work together like a musical chord.\r\n\r\nPerfume oils contain volatile compounds in high concentrations and thus have to be diluted by solvents, so that injury is not caused when applied directly on skin or clothes.  The common solvent is pure ethanol or ethanol mixed with water.  Fractionated coconut oil or wax, neutral smelling fats such as jojoba, can also act as solvents and dilute the perfume oil.  The perfume oil is further mixed with other aromatic compounds.  Generally, the percentage of aromatic compounds in perfume extract is 20% to 40%; in eau de parfum is 10% to 30%; in eau de toilette is 5% to 20%; and in eau de cologne is 2% to 5%.  \r\n\r\nThe oil concentration in a perfume along with other aromatic compounds, determines the intensity, longevity, and price of the perfume and thus it is a closely guarded secret of every perfumer and perfume house.  By adjusting the percentage level and the notes of the perfume, variations on the same brand may be created like Chanel////s Pour Monsieur and Pour Monsieur Concentree.\r\n\r\nClassification of perfumes is never complete, due to its ever-evolving nature.  The traditional classification comprises of categories like Single Floral, Floral Bouquet, Ambery, Woody, Leather, Chypre, and Fougere; while the modern classification comprises of Bright Floral, Green, Oceanic/Ozone, Citrus/Fruity, and Gourmand. In 1983, Michael Edwards, a perfume consultant, created a new fragrance classification \"The Fragrance Wheel\", which classified and sub-grouped five standard families, namely Floral (Floral, Soft Floral, Floral Oriental), Oriental (Soft Oriental, Oriental, Woody Oriental), Woody (Wood, Mossy Woods, Dry Woods), Fougere (has fragrance elements from all the families), and Fresh (Citrus, Green, Water).\r\n\r\nPerfumery has used a number of aromatic sources like plants, animals, and synthetic sources in the making of perfumes.  Plants are used as a source of aroma compounds and essential oils.  The parts of plants that are used are:\r\n\r\n1 - Bark (cinnamon, cascarilla); \r\n2 - Flowers (rose, jasmine, osmanthus, tuberose, mimosa, vanilla); \r\n3 - Blossoms (citrus, ylang-ylang, clove); \r\n4 - Fruits (apples, strawberries, cherries, litsea cubeba, juniper berry, vanilla, oranges, lemons, limes, grapefruit);\r\n5 - Leaves and Twigs (lavender, patchouli, citrus, violets, sage, rosemary, hay, tomato);\r\n6 - Resins (labdanum, myrrh, gum benzoin, Peru balsam, frankincense/olibanum, pine, fir, amber, copal); \r\n7 - Roots, Bulbs, and Rhizomes (vetiver roots, ginger and iris rhizomes); \r\n8 - Seeds (coriander, cocoa, mace, cardamom, anise, nutmeg, caraway, tonka bean); \r\n9 - Woods (agarwood, birch, rosewood, sandalwood, pine, birch, juniper, cedar).  \r\n\r\nAnimal sources include Ambergris, Castoreum, Musk, Rom terpenes, Honeycomb, and Civet.  Other natural sources include Lichens and Protists.  Synthetic sources include synthetic odorants synthesized from petroleum distillates, pine resins, etc.  Modern perfumes are mostly made from synthetic sources as they allow fragrances not found in nature, like Calone is a synthetic compound that imparts a marine metallic ozonous fragrance.  Synthetic aromatics are more consistent than natural aromatics, and are hence, widely used nowadays in modern available perfumes.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAuthor Bio\r\nThis article can also be accessed in portuguese language from the News Article section of page www.polomercantil.com.br/perfume-fragrancia.php - Roberto Sedycias works as IT consultant for PoloMercantil\r\n\r\nArticle Source: http://www.ArticleGeek.com - Free Website Content\r\n\r\n', 'top5', '', 50, '2017-08-12 21:41:09', 58, 'top 5\r\nfacts\r\nfact\r\nperfume\r\ncologne\r\n'),

When the light fails to reflect back, the photocell realizes there is no land there and doesn////t register anything, so the electronic circuit generates the number zero ( 0s ). Thus the scanning laser and electronic circuit gradually recreates the pattern of zeros and ones (binary digits) that were originally stored on the disc in the factory. Another electronic circuit in the CD player (called a digital to analog converter or DAC) decodes these binary numbers and converts them back into a changing pattern of electric currents.\r\n\r\nA loudspeaker transforms the electric currents into sounds .\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n', 'how-to', '', 135, '2017-08-12 21:28:49', 41, 'cd\r\nCD\r\ncompact disk\r\nhow to\r\ncd work\r\ndisc\r\nphotoelectric\r\ncell\r\ndvd\r\ncd player\r\n'),

The theory of general relativity predicts that a sufficiently compact mass can deform spacetime to form a black hole.  The gravity of black hole is so strong it effects that light can////t come out from it , if once it enter.\r\n\r\n\r\n<b>Formation of black hole</b> Stellar black holes form when the center of a very massive star collapses in upon itself. This collapse also causes a supernova, or an exploding star, that blasts part of the star into space. Scientists think supermassive black holes formed at the same time as the galaxy they are in.\r\n\r\n\r\n<b>Discovery of black hole </b>Albert Einstein first predicted black holes in 1916 with his general theory of relativity. The term \"black hole\" was coined in 1967 by American astronomer John Wheeler, and the first one was discovered in 1971. There are three types: stellar black holes, supermassive black holes and intermediate black holes.\r\n\r\n<b>Consequence </b>Closer to the center, gravity is even stronger.

But the focus can be limited . It is limited to the range of the lens. This range when adjusted to get a perfect image is called the focus of the camera. It is consists of a wide-angle lens and a small aperture in front of the camera. , the device is comprised of a fixed focus For accurate focussing of cameras.\r\n\r\nThe focus available on each camera is different. Single-lens reflex (SLR) cameras have a focus that can be changed according to our desire . It is done by objective lens and a moving mirror so as to projecting the image to a ground glass or plastic micro-prism screen. \r\n\r\n\r\nCamera Lens  The quality of the Picture ( photograph ) depends on the type of lens . The precision of a lens depends on bending angle depends on the structure of the lens. If the structure of lens has a flat shape, the bending angle is less. The light beams will converge a little distance farther away from the lens. Thus the image is formed farther away. When the distance increases, the size of the image also increases, though the size of the film is constant. If the lens has a round shape, the bending angle will be high. Thus the image will be formed a lot more nearer to the lens.\r\n\r\nWhen you want to take a photograph with a film camera, you have to press a button. This operates a mechanism called the shutter, which makes a hole (the aperture) open briefly at the front of the camera, allowing light to enter through the lens. The light causes reactions to take place in the chemicals on the film, thus storing the picture in front of you.\r\n\r\nCamera Film To record image it use film to store picture and videos. When an image is captured, it is actually being chemically recorded onto a film. The film  consists of millions of light-sensitive grains, it is on the plastic strip. These grains chemically react, when exposed to light. This reaction causes the image to be recorded on the film. This film is then developed by reacting it with other chemicals. For black and white films, the chemicals cause the grains to appear darker when exposed to light. Thus, the darker areas appear lighter and the lighter areas appear darker. This is reversed while printing out the photos.\r\n\r\nFor producing colour films, the film consists of light sensitive materials that respond to colours red, green and blue. When they are washed and chemically reacted, you get a negative of a colour photo.', 'how-to', '', 162, '2017-08-13 18:38:44', 31, 'camera\r\nanatomy\r\nworking\r\nbasics\r\ndigital camera\r\nslr\r\ndslr\r\nrecord\r\ncapture\r\npicture'),
